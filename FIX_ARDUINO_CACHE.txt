================================
   FIX ARDUINO IDE CACHE ISSUE
================================

The src folder has been DELETED.

BUT Arduino IDE cached the old compilation files.

HOW TO FIX:
-----------

METHOD 1 (Easiest):
1. CLOSE Arduino IDE completely
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. REOPEN Arduino IDE
4. File → Open → emg_function.ino
5. Click Upload
6. Should work now!

METHOD 2 (If Method 1 doesn't work):
1. Close Arduino IDE
2. Delete this folder:
   C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\arduino\sketches\20ECAE1479B779D9A737148390C5E9DD
3. Reopen Arduino IDE
4. Upload again

METHOD 3 (Nuclear option):
In Arduino IDE:
1. Sketch → Show Sketch Folder
2. Close Arduino IDE
3. Delete the "build" folder if it exists
4. Reopen Arduino IDE
5. Upload again

================================
   WHY THIS HAPPENED
================================

Arduino IDE compiles files into a cache folder.
Even though we deleted src/main.cpp, the
cached .o file still existed, causing conflicts.

Restarting Arduino IDE forces a fresh build.
